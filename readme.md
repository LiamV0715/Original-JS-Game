This is the code for Seratonin Sprint! The game where you (a brain) have to go get
some yummy seratonin or you may become sad. A scrolling background brings you through neurons and time as you collect the molecules of seratonin, but watch out! If you don't get enough seratonin during the course, you'll become sad! Also, obstacles (obstacles coming soon) may block your path and decrease your score!
Try to find the "dopamine" items to get a multiplier on seratonin pickups!
If you reach (required score) by the end of the course you win! 

Hope you're happy! *ba dum tss*
